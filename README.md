# Requestbite 

[Requestbite](https://requestbite.com) is a growing collection of tools with the goal of making it easier to send, receive, and inspect HTTP traffic - the type of data that makes up most of the web. We're currently working on building and improving the following tools:

## Inspector

Inspector allows you to inspect incoming HTTP traffic - it's the perfect tool for debugging webhooks and API calls from online services. Send data to permanent URLs for easy debugging and analysis.

## Mock (coming soon)

Mock will be a service that allows you to easily set up mock REST APIs so that you can test your frontend or client applications without having to set up a full backend.

## Slingshot (coming soon)

Slingshot will be an online REST API client that allows you to easily send HTTP requests and inspect the responses. It will allow you to model new APIs as well as interact and debug existing APIs.

## Tunnel Vision (coming soon)

Tunnel Vision will allow you to easily connect to services that are only available on `localhost`, behind a firewall or that are only accessible via a VPN. Allow others temporary access to the local API you're building, or connect to your local development environment from anywhere.
